<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc267847">
<p>
I have been practicing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wim_Hof">Wim Hof</a> Method for years.
It is a spiritual path of sorts.
</p>

<p>
There is this thing where you embrace being an animal, and animals
are really hardcore man.
</p>

<p>
Human animals plan, think and discover how to world works.
</p>

<p>
The brain is the control hub of our inner physiology also.
</p>

<p>
Getting in touch with your physiology is not mystical, and not reserved
for a certain kind of person either.
It is using the paths in your brain that evolved to do just
that. <sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
To close the loop: The inner physiology is another part of the
world. With its mechanics, story, characters and places
that can be discovered - and mastered to various degrees.
Such is the human way, you are the animal
that uses thought
has thought
likes stories
</p>


<p>
Where can you start? With the things you already have control
over. Hence breathing techniques, stretching and cold exposure.
</p>

<p>
Emphasize the in-breath over the out-breath and you are pumping adrenaline.
The other way around and you get more relaxed.
</p>

<p>
Cold exposure pumps dopamine, with a long arc. <sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup>  It makes the whole day awesome.
A cold shower is already an achievement that sets you up for performance.
</p>

<p>
Wim has mentioned somewhere on the free part of his app something
about determinism and having "the cold as a teacher". An upsight
clicked clicked in me that will try to share here.

<h2 id="org88410eb">One way to learn is to learn on a playground</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org88410eb">
<p>
I will now put together 2 ideas. Learning on a playground and
discovering the <i>rest of your brain</i>.
</p>

<p>
There is a reason we make hello world programs. We learn in the small
what is similar for the large.
</p>

<p>
Say Wim Hof is right and determinism is a mental thing I can grab, or a place I can go to
in mind, how do I learn to do so?
</p>

<p>
Also importantly, how do you even know you are doing it?
</p>

<p>
Enter cold showers ("The cold is our teacher").
It is hard to kill yourself with a cold shower, yet it takes mental
energy to go into one and to stay. It gives you a chance to be
determined in a small, controlled, safe environment.
</p>

<p>
You manage to endure a wall of physical discomfort, you are doing
it. This is what determinism is.
</p>

<p>
<i>just do it</i>
</p>

<p>
In the lore of Wim-hoffing, you keep a calm mind and observe yourself
being able to <i>do it</i>.
</p>

<p>
You are deploying the mental capacities that you might call <code>determinism</code>.
</p>

<p>
The cold shower is the playground that allows you to see how it is to
be determined.
</p>

<p>
You observe the mentality, the mechanics, the feel, the drive, the
<i>just doing</i> it. What you <i>are</i> when you are being determined.
</p>

<p>
This then, shows you how to be determined elsewhere.
The cold is not an end goal, it is a simple, easy playground where we
can test how it is to be determined.
This also means we have a benchmark for whether we are deploying
determinism, or not.
</p>

<p>
To learn something you need some way of telling whether you are
doing it right.
</p>

<p>
I connect this to an experience I had while I was learning to juggle.
There was a moment when I was doing 1 or 2 balls when I realized:
here is a limit, a place where I can invest in training and I will get
better and build a foundation and eventually be able to juggle. (I was right).

The only place where you can grow is at the edge.

<a href="https://hubermanlab.com/">Professor Huberman</a> is since recently one of the great science
communicators of our time.
About physiology, neuroscience and (my words) frankly, the human soul.

<p>
Transcript from a recent Q&amp;A event (you can find it on the Huberman lab
podcast feed):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
If you want to get the most out of the cold exposure then you want to get
to that point of "I want to get out of here, but I know I can
stay in safely, but I really want to get out of here".
</p>

<p>
It's a little hard to explain, but there is just
so much learning in those short moments about where your mind goes.
And this sounds subjective and maybe a little whishy-washy.
You can realize great things about yourself in those moments.
You can find insight in those moments.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I agree. I call this learning how to be determined.

<h2 id="orga668fc0">The practice</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orga668fc0">
<p>
I can recommend the Wim hof app to get started. There is a diary thing
where you start with 10-second cold showers after a warm shower etc.
</p>

<p>
Tip: if you have a dispatchable shower head, put it in your hand and
move it around. Cold exposure is all about control. If you have the
shower head in your hand, you gain control.
