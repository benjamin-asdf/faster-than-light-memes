* Introduction

I sometimes get asked

#+begin_quote
What is the single most important package in your emacs config that
makes you more productive?
#+end_quote

* Hello, bash-completion

* async-shell-command and friends


* babashka tasks

I can write build tasks in my favority language clojure, with the
development ergonomics of a lisp.



* compilation

Using emacs ~project.el~ I get a beautiful flow of invoking bb tasks:
I just need a project with a =.git= dir.
And I invoke ~project-compile~, type in ~bb


* it gets even better
With a recent version of emacs
revert-buffer-function



* more levers

a lever
a doorway
