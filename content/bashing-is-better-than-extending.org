* Introduction

I sometimes get asked something along the lines of


#+begin_quote
What is the single most important package in your emacs config that
makes you more productive?
#+end_quote


* Lever

Levers are great.
They make it possible to have a large effect with little

effort
output with input



* Hello, bash-completion

* async-shell-command and friends


* babashka tasks

I can write build tasks in my favority language clojure, with the
development ergonomics of a lisp.



* compilation

Using emacs ~project.el~ I get a beautiful flow of invoking bb tasks:
I just need a project with a =.git= dir.
And I invoke ~project-compile~, type in ~bb


* It gets even better

Sometimes you want to run the same command over and over.
For example when compiling or devving some script.

Now you might start doing
scm
and the ~C-p~ to go up in the history everytime.


With a recent version of emacs
revert-buffer-function
Lol, so good.
