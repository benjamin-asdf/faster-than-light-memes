Benjamin Schwerdtners blog

This is up here:

Make a blog using org and use babashka as build tool.

I take the website content straight from my [[https://github.com/protesilaos/denote][denote]] notes dir.
Deploying is currently =scp= into a linode server.

* build

#+begin_src shell
bb tasks
#+end_src

for a list of available commands.

You need to set ~ftlm/index-file~ and ~denote-directory~ in =build-site.el=.

** deps:
